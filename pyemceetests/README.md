Python package for atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium

### Description
The **pyemcee** package is a collection of [Python](https://www.python.org/) programs developed to calculate atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium in multi-level atoms for different physical conditions of the stratification layers where the chemical elements are ionized. This library includes the Python version of the program [mcfit](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft03005H), which was originally written in Fortran by [Howarth & Adams (1981)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ucl..rept.....H), and was recently converted to Python.

### Installation
To install the last version, all you should need to do is

    python setup.py install

To install the stable version, you can use the preferred installer program (pip):

    pip install pyemcee
