Python implementation of the affine-invariant MCMC Hammer

### Description
**pyemcee** is a Python implementation of the affine-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler, based on [sl_emcee](https://github.com/mcfit/sl_emcee) by M. A. Nowak, an S-Lang/[ISIS](http://space.mit.edu/cxc/isis/) implementation of the MCMC Hammer proposed by [Goodman & Weare (2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/camcos.2010.5.65), and also implemented in Python ([emcee](https://github.com/dfm/emcee)) by [Foreman-Mackey et al. (2013)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125..306F).
